# Full Stack API Final Project

## Full Stack Trivia Quiz Game

Udacity is invested in creating bonding experiences for its employees and students. A bunch of team members got the idea to hold trivia on a regular basis and created a webpage to manage the trivia app and play the game. 

With this application you will be able to:

1. Display all questions and by category. The trivia questions show each question, its category category and the difficulty rating. You can also show & hide the answer. 
2. Delete questions. Delete questions that are no longer needed.
3. Add questions and require that they include question and answer text through validation.
4. Search for questions based on a text query string.
5. Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category. 

## Tasks

There is a frontend and a backend stack. The backend will provide the model for the API while the frontend will provide the view of the application using React.

1. [`./backend/`](./backend/README.md)
2. [`./frontend/`](./frontend/README.md)

We recommend following the instructions in those files in the order above.

### Backend

The `./backend` directory contains the completed Flask and SQLAlchemy servers. In the backend/\__init__.py file you will find the defined endpoints and references the models.py file for DB and SQLAlchemy setup.

### Frontend

The `./frontend` directory contains a complete React frontend to consume the data from the backend Flask server.

Pay special attention to what data the frontend is expecting from each API response to help guide how you format your API. 

1. [View the README.md within ./backend for more details.](./backend/README.md)

2. [View the README.md within ./frontend for more details.](./frontend/README.md)
