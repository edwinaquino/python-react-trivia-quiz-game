# Full Stack Trivia Quiz Game - Backend

## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.8.2

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Virtual Enviornment

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organized. Instructions for setting up a virtual environment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by navigating to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite database. You'll primarily work in app.py and can reference models.py. 

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server. 

## Database Setup
With Postgres running, restore a database using the trivia.psql file provided. From the backend folder in terminal run:
```bash
psql trivia < trivia.psql
```

### Database Settings

Open the /backend/models.py file and edit the database credentials to connect to your local postgresql database:
```
database_path = "postgres://{}:{}@{}/{}".format('USERNAME', 'PASSWORD', 'localhost:5432', database_name)
```    

## Running the server

Open a terminal and from within the `backend/` directory run the server with the following commands:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```
__ERROR__: If you get this error: `OSError: [Errno 98] Address already in use` - The default port is 5001, you can choose to run the Flask server on a different port with the following command:

```bash
flask run --port 5001
```

__NOTE:__ Setting the `FLASK_ENV` variable to `development` will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.

__NOTE:__ Setting the `FLASK_APP` variable to `flaskr` directs flask to use the `flaskr` directory and the `__init__.py` file to find the application. 

Open a broswer to test successful running of Flask server and navigate to: http://127.0.0.1:5000/questions

## Testing
This repository includes a file `development` to test your API requests. To run the included tests, open a terminal in the `backend/` directory and execute the following commands:
```bash
dropdb trivia_test
createdb trivia_test
psql trivia_test < trivia.psql
python test_flaskr.py
```


## API Reference

### Getting Started
- Base URL: At present this app can only be run locally and is not hosted as a base URL. The backend app is hosted at the default, `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`, which is set as a proxy in the frontend configuration. 
- Authentication: This version of the application does not require authentication or API keys. 
- Open a broswer navigate to: http://127.0.0.1:5000/questions


### Error Handling
Errors are returned in the following json format:

```json
      {
        "success": "False",
        "error": 422,
        "message": "Unprocessable entity",
      }
```
The API will return three error types when requests fail:
- 400: Bad Request
- 404: Resource Not Found
- 422: Not Processable 
- 500 â€“ internal server error
